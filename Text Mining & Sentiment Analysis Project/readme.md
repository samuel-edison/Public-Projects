Executive Summary

This study reviews at a subset of news agencies and the articles/tweets they produce.  Multiple techniques such as Web Scraping, Visual Analytics, Text Mining, and Sentiment Analysis are used to compare and contrast the differences between the news broadcasters in the context of the 2020 Presidential Election. The information gathered from the news broadcasters, web articles and twitter, were used to create metrics that indicate bias when mentioning certain candidates and political parties. 
Our mission is to identify instances of this media bias in hopes give awareness to American citizens who follow mainstream news. For the purposes of this report, bias was identified by the percentage of non-neutral sentiments in a given article or tweet. All analysis completed in this study was done using the open source programming language of Python.

Statement of Scope

This study uses six web articles from each source, CNN and Fox News (12 articles total). Additionally, every tweet from the corresponding news broadcaster from October 20th, 2020 through November 2nd, 2020 is used. To reproduce this analysis would require the access to web articles, a twitter developer account, and Python.
